# RealEstatimator


1. Download estimator.py and dict.json

2. Make sure that the estimator.py and dict.json file are in the same folder

3. Begin running estimator.py and inputting answers to questions asked
#
More detailed version and info about the code setup below.
#
For this project, you will need to download the dict.json file. This json file is information gathered about 196 houses in the town of Bear, DE.
#
Once downloaded, confirm estimator.py and dict.json file are located in the same folder.
#
At this point, you are ready to run the estimator.py file. You will get some introduction information printed out to the console before you begin answering questions for the estimation.
#
In the estimator.py file, there are numerous sections. The first section is all the functions that we wrote and use. After these, each feature of a house has its own section denoted by the "start" and "end" comments.
#
The features were research to determine the value that each one has on a house appraisal. Some features were able to be estimated specifically on the value they have in Bear, DE. Otherwise were general to Delaware, the Northeast, and the United States. We looked for as precise of a value as possible.
#
One of the most important aspects of appraising a house is finding a recently sold comparison to adjust all of the values of the features. For example, in upstate NY, a basement is very common. Conversely, a lot of houses in Delaware don't have basements. For this reason, a "comparator" was implemented after the value of the features were implemented. The "comparator" looks for the 1-5 most comparable houses in Bear, DE and compares the value of that house to the value of the house input by the user. If comparable, the estimation of the house stays the same. If the estimation is outside a reasonable range, then
#the "comparator" will adjust the estimation.
#
Finally, there is a function that determines the error of the estimation compared to "eppraisal" and Zillow's "zestimate." These appraisal companies report accuracy of upwards of 1.8%, but if you go through and compare by hand Zillow's estimates are often off by more than 5% 63% of the time. For this reason, we felt pretty successful if we could be around 5% off or better 50% of the time.
